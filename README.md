# unintended-storage-cycling study

The reproduce the results:

- Familiarise yourself with PyPSA-Eur and how to install it.
- Run the submodule incl. its environments and implement the script provided in "Model_script_github". To install this repo type: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/pz-max/unintended-storage-cycling.git` (--recursive is necessary to retrieve also the submodule content which refers to one specific PyPSA-Eur version)
- Especially, the "config.yaml" within the "Model_script_github" folder need to be adjusted to create three different solver scenarios (see preprint)


Scripts for plots:

- Open Model_script_github > plots
- Here we provide most plotting scripts that allows you to replicate the illustrations
- Paths need to be adjusted according to the location where you placed your results
- Some csv files are attached in the plotting folder which allow some script to work

Note. The code came from my rookie years. Future work will make it much simpler to reproduce my work (os path setting, better scripting/ organisation)
